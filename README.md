# Tree-Based Statistical Method for Drug-Drug Interaction Signal Detection

## Overview
This research presents a novel statistical methodology for detecting drug-drug interaction (DDI) signals in post-market drug safety surveillance. The method uniquely combines tree-based scan statistics with a multiplicative interaction model to address key challenges in pharmacovigilance.

## Background
Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) pose significant health risks when multiple medications are used concurrently. While clinical trials effectively evaluate single-drug safety, they often miss potential interactions between drugs. This gap makes post-market surveillance through spontaneous reporting systems crucial for drug safety monitoring.

## Problem Statement
Existing methods for detecting DDI signals face two major limitations:
1. Inadequate handling of the hierarchical structure of adverse events (AEs)
2. Insufficient accounting for potential reporting bias in spontaneous reporting systems

## Methodology
Our approach introduces two key innovations:
- Implementation of tree-based scan statistics to model the hierarchical structure of adverse events
- Integration of a multiplicative interaction model to mitigate reporting bias

## Key Findings
The methodology demonstrated:
- Effective control of type I error at pre-specified significance levels
- Consistent performance metrics across various scenarios:
  - Maintained power
  - Sustained sensitivity
  - Controlled false discovery rate
- Robust performance even in the presence of reporting bias

## Significance
This research addresses critical gaps in post-market drug safety surveillance:
1. Provides equal attention to DDI-induced adverse events as single-drug events
2. Addresses the reporting bias inherent in spontaneous reporting systems
3. Offers a more comprehensive approach to signal detection
